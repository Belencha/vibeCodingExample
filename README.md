# vibeCodingExample
An experiment of how can I vibe coding about something random

## Logbook

📅 2025-12-19

Summary of what we accomplished the second day of vibe coding:
- ✅ MERN stack project structure (client + server)
- ✅ Server: TypeScript, Express, MongoDB setup
- ✅ Client: React app working
- ✅ Fixed npm vulnerabilities (high-severity ones)
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors
- ✅ LF line endings configured
- ✅ All changes committed

So from now on I am going to ask Cursor to create an MVP for a real app that can give value to a user. I am going to focus on politics. Let's see if I can achieve something.
